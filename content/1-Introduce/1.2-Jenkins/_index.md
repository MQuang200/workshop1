Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software development. It facilitates the automation of building, testing, and deploying code, making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project and enabling quicker delivery of features and fixes. Jenkins supports various version control tools and can execute a series of scripts and commands in response to various triggers. With its extensive plugin ecosystem, Jenkins can be customized to fit almost any CI/CD need, from simple to complex workflows. It is designed to be both powerful and flexible, allowing teams to accelerate their software development processes efficiently. Jenkins can be run on most operating systems and is a pivotal tool for DevOps practices, enhancing collaboration and productivity across development and operations teams.
