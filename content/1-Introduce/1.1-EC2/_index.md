Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a foundational piece of AWS's cloud computing platform, offering scalable virtual server capacity. EC2 provides users with flexible computing power, allowing them to easily scale up or down based on their needs. This service simplifies web-scale cloud computing by enabling developers and businesses to run applications and services on a global network of Amazon's managed data centers. Users can select from a variety of instance types, operating systems, and software packages, making EC2 suitable for a wide range of computing tasks, from serving web applications to running large-scale distributed systems. With EC2, you pay only for the compute time you use, making it a cost-effective solution for many computing scenarios.
>For this tutorial, we will use EC2 as a linux server to deploy our Java Springboot project
